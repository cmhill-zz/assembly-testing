Breakpoint Analysis
===

In order to run our code you will require:

1. Set of contigs to run your reads against (this will be called the assembly)
2. Set of unaligned reads (this is generated by bowtie)


You run our program as follows:

    python breakpoint_indices.py -a <assembly file> 
    -u <unaligned reads file> -o <output for detected errors> 
    --alpha <alpha>
    
The detected errors will be spilled into the output file. The alpha determines the legngth of the string at the front of the sequence we will attempt to match.

For more examples of how to run our program, look at the test scripts. They're informative and well commented.
