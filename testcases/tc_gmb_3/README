We use "lambda virus" genome in this test. The reference genome and reads used in this test is taken from Bowtie 2 tutorial. We created BAM file and its index by using combination of Bowtie 2 and samtools.

We pick this test for our feasibility study. The fasta file for the genome contains only single reference and we created artificial misassemblies on the genome by inverting regions between base pair locations listed in oracle file. In this test we do inversion on multiple regions; more specifically, 3 regions.

In other feasibility good-minus-bad analysis test cases (tc_gmb_1 and tc_gmb_2), we tested on a single region. By inverting multiple regions, we test whether having more than one inversion have negative effect on our analysis.
