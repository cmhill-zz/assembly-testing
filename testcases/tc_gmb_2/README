We use "lambda virus" genome in this test. The reference genome and reads used in this test is taken from Bowtie 2 tutorial. We created BAM file and its index by using combination of Bowtie 2 and samtools.

We pick this test for our feasibility study. The fasta file for the genome contains only single reference and we created an artificial misassembly on the genome by inverting region between base pair locations listed in oracle file. In this test we do inversion on single long region (compared to tc_gmb_1), 700 base pairs.

Doing inversion on shorter region tests the sensitivity of our analysis to the length of the region.
